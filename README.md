# Hi üëã, I'm Josenaldo de Oliveira Matos Filho

My name is Josenaldo but you can call me JOM. I'm a software developer based in Uberl√¢ndia, Minas Gerais, Brasil. I specialize in full stack development and have more than 20 years of experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills & Proficiencies

Throughout my career, I've gained a wide array of technical skills, varying in levels of proficiency. I've categorized them into four main groups to provide a clear understanding of my capabilities:

### Fluent

These are the skills with which I'm entirely comfortable and can start working immediately without the need for review or reference. I am highly proficient and up-to-date with the current practices.
